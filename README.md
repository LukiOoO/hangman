# hangman and message generator


code hangman:
-the functions and random module are responsible for the logic of the code 
- for displaying the hanged man I created a separate module and I used the turtle module 
- hang hangman gets words from separate txt file
message generator code:
-messages imported from csv file 
- functions are responsible for the code 

both programs are handled by the try method
